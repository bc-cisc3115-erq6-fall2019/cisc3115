## Lab Exercise 11/14/2019

A JavaFX application needs a primary launch class. This class has to extend the [javafx.application.Application][1] class which is a standard class in Java since Java 8.

Youâ€™ll be building this Split Bill Calculator interface with JavaFX. You can work in small teams or individually on this task. Submit the link here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgIVgu56J9oI_PZfXWVTN5zCvgi47myXm4VuXP7NpxKoZJSw/viewform

*Note: JavaFX comes with Java 8. Any newer versions of Java (9+) will require separate installation of JavaFX.*

The fields to include in your GUI are (in any sensical order and layout):
* Bill = any whole or decimal number
* Sales Tax = this figure will be converted to a percentage. 5 = 5%
* Split = number of ways to split the bill.

Final value = [Bill + (Bill * sales tax as %)] / Split

Buttons:
* Calculate will calculate the total. Make sure you have exception handling built in.
* Clear will clear the text fields.
* Exit will close the GUI applet.



Example: with the fields filled in
